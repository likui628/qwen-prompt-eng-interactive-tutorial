# Claude Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial (Qwen Edition)

## Overview

Since using Claude API in China can be inconvenient, this tutorial provides a localized version using **Qwen models**. You can learn and practice prompt engineering techniques in your local environment through Alibaba Cloud's Qwen API.

This version adapts the original [Claude prompt engineering tutorial](https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial) for Qwen models, allowing users in China to conveniently learn best practices in large language model prompt engineering.

## Course Introduction

This course aims to help you comprehensively and systematically master how to design optimal prompts for large language models. Although the original tutorial targets Claude, the core principles and techniques of prompt engineering equally apply to other large language models like Qwen.

**After completing this course, you will be able to**:
- Master the basic structure of effective prompts
- Identify common failure patterns and learn "80/20" techniques to address them
- Understand the strengths and limitations of large language models
- Build powerful prompts for common use cases from scratch

## Course Structure

This course contains **9 chapters with accompanying exercises**, plus an appendix with additional advanced methods. It is recommended that you **study the chapters in order**.

**At the bottom of each lesson there is a "Practice Sandbox"**, where you can freely experiment with course examples and personally experience how changing prompts affects Qwen's responses.

When ready, open `01_Basic_Prompt_Structure.ipynb` to start learning.
